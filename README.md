# Exercises using R
:octocat: David Campero Ma√±a  

This project consists of developing a variety of R exercises to practice. These exercises belonged to the subject of probability (Mathematics III). 

:bulb: There are, at the moment, Spanish PDF reports in everyone foler which explain the entire project and all stages of development. 
Soon, I will upload an English version. Sorry for the inconvenience.
