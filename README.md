# Exercises using R
:octocat: David Campero Ma√±a  

This project consists of developing a variety of R exercises to practice. These exercises belonged to the probability course (Mathematics III) taught at the University of Huelva.  

:bulb: There are, at the moment, Spanish PDF reports in everyone foler which explain the parts of the project.  
Soon, I will upload an English version. Sorry for the inconvenience.
